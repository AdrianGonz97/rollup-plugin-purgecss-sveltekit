A simple vite plugin that **thoroughly** purges excess CSS from [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) projects using [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/). This package should be used in combination with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and a Tailwind specific UI library such as [Skeleton](https://skeleton.dev).

## Motivation

PurgeCSS is an excellent package that removes unused CSS. Their provided plugins for extraction do a decent enough job for simple projects. However, plugins such as [postcss-purgecss](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss/tree/main/packages/postcss-purgecss) and [rollup-plugin-purgecss](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss/tree/main/packages/rollup-plugin-purgecss) take a rather naive approach to selector extraction. They only analyze the content that is passed to them through their `content` fields, which means that if you pass a UI library to it, none of the selectors that are **unused** in your project (such as components that aren't imported) will be properly purged. Leaving you with a larger than necessary CSS bundle.

Ideally, we'd like to keep the selectors that are only used in your project. We accomplish by analyzing the emitted JS chunks that are generated by Rollup, and extracting out any of their possible selectors. From there, we can pass along the selectors to PurgeCSS for final processing.

## ⚠ Caveats ⚠

This package is still very **experimental**. Breaking changes can occur at any time. We'll stabilize once we hit a `1.0.0` release.

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
npm i -D vite-plugin-svelte-purgecss
```

### Add to Vite

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { purgeCss } from 'vite-plugin-svelte-purgecss';

const config: UserConfig = {
	plugins: [sveltekit(), purgeCss()],
};
```

If selectors that shouldn't be purged are being removed, simply add them to the `safelist`.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { purgeCss } from 'vite-plugin-svelte-purgecss';

const config: UserConfig = {
	plugins: [
		sveltekit(),
		purgeCss({
			safelist: {
				// any selectors that begin with "hljs-" will not be purged
				greedy: [/^hljs-/],
			},
		}),
	],
};
```
